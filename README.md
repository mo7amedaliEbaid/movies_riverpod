# movies_riverpod

 movies_riverpod is a versatile Flutter app designed for seamless movie exploration across different platforms. The app follows a Clean Architecture pattern, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. It has been successfully tested on mobile platforms (Android, iOS) and desktop (Linux).

## Directory Structure.

üìÅ **core:** Houses fundamental components essential for the application, such as the main app configuration (`app.dart`), error handling (`observers.dart`), extensions, constants, and other core functionalities.

üìÅ **di (Dependency Injection):** Manages the dependency injection logic for improved code organization and testability. The `injector.dart` file resides here.

üìÅ **features:** Organized into three subdirectories: `data` for data-related logic and repositories, `domain` for domain entities and use cases, and `presentation` for UI screens and widgets. This follows a clean architecture approach, promoting separation of concerns.

üìÅ **models:** Contains the data models used throughout the application, such as `movies.dart` and `casts.dart`.

üìÑ **main.dart:** The entry point of the application, where the execution begins. It imports and initializes necessary components to kickstart the Flutter app.
